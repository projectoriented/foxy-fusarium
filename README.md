# Research Training, VT2020
A course at Uppsala University. Bioinformatics, MSc. The aims of this course is to acclimate to a research environment, contribute knowledge and skills where necessary, learn about the topic assigned and observe the group's daily duties. Throughout the course, I learned indepth about Fusarium f.sp Oxysporum that infects different agricultural groups and whether there's an affinity mechanism behind that. In this repo you'll find scripts I used to mine data from NCBI to create my own specific database for use in a deeper analysis to uncover some insights about the organism in question.

**Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/projectoriented/foxy-fusarium/wiki) for the paper I wrote logging my contributions to this course and the research group.** ðŸ˜€
